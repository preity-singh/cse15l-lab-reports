# Part 1 - Debugging Scenario
Design a debugging scenario, and write your report as a conversation on EdStem. It should have:

```
Hello! I am working on my Grade Server and am trying to run the grade.sh file. I will copy the terminal results I am getting, but it seems to output a skeleton version of the correct response.
```

# Part 2 â€“ Reflection

* One of the most valuable lessons I learned in the second half of this quarter was Jupyter Development Platform (JDP). Learning about JDP and its user-friendly interface for coding and documentation was eye-opening for me. JDP is probably one of the most beneficial tools we learned in this software tools course and I plan on using it during the debugging process in my future CS courses, but also in my future career as a software developer.
